# Additional recommendations

* Follow my macOS settings [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/macos-settings).

* Use a content blocking extension like [AdGuard](https://apps.apple.com/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259). *See my recommended settings [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-safari-settings-macos)*.

* Use a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice. I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration if you are able to *(See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/nextdns-settings))*, otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/).

* Enable [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/105120).

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).
